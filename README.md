# Frontend Mentor Challenge : Multi-step form

Submission for Frontend Mentor challenge [Multi-step form]() written in VueJS with Pinia store. 

Most challenging part of this was to make an adaptable Vue component to cover both the plan and addon selection. The checkbox solution adapted from Jonarod's [Simple Custom CheckBox](https://gist.github.com/Jonarod/7ff2fe4f81aae39e431aa7a08ce815bc).
